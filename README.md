<h1>Python Review</h1>
<h5>This repo consists of me revewing my Python skills after having learnt it around~2020 and 2021.
I automated a big deal of Linear Algebra Assigmnets along the way, I'll share some screenshots below</h5>

<h3>Quick Note</h3>
I do want to make a visual interpretation of this in the future. For the moment being, it is just text *:)*
Gram Schmidt Algorithm. Generate an orthogonal basis from any vector V = {n1,n2,...}

<h3>What I learned</h3>
Python is very efficient and friendly at computational tasks. 
I can now see why python is widley used in all types of data science, research, and developement. Thanks for stopping by!
